# Stopwatch in JavaScript ‚è±Ô∏è

Welcome to my very first project in programming! üöÄ‚ú® This stopwatch was the beginning of my coding journey, and I'm excited to share it with you. 

## Project Overview

This is a simple yet functional stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to help you measure time with just a few clicks. Whether you're timing your workout, a cooking session, or just racing against the clock, this stopwatch has got you covered!
